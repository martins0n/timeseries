| [Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07820.pdf) | By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performanceof purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks |
